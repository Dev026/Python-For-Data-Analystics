Credit Card Retention Analysis
Overview
This repository contains code and data for analyzing credit card retention. The goal of this analysis is to explore factors influencing customer retention within a credit card business. By examining various attributes such as customer demographics, transaction history, and behavior, the objective is to identify patterns and insights that contribute to customer churn or retention.

Files
BankChurners_v2.csv: Dataset containing customer information and related metrics.
credit_card_retention_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
README.md: Documentation providing an overview of the project.
Contents
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset structure, identifying key features, and exploring relationships between variables.
Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features or attributes that may impact credit card retention.
Visualization: Creating visual representations (graphs, charts) to illustrate trends and patterns in customer behavior.
Modeling (if applicable): Building predictive models to forecast customer churn and exploring potential strategies for retention.
Usage
The credit_card_retention_analysis.ipynb notebook contains the code used for analysis. It can be executed in a Jupyter environment after installing the required libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc.).
The BankChurners_v2.csv dataset should be placed in the same directory as the notebook for proper execution.
Clone or download this repository to access the code and data.
Notes
This analysis aims to provide insights into credit card retention but might not cover all aspects or factors influencing customer behavior.
Additional data or external factors not included in the dataset may impact the analysis and its conclusions.
Feel free to explore, modify, or extend this analysis for further research or specific business use cases.
